# Recruitment task

The aim of the task was to create an automaton in Make, along with a JS/TS server that would receive information from it.

The Node.js environment and the Express framework were used to implement the server. The server runs locally on port 3000 (localhost:3000). To test its cooperation with the machine made in Make, the "ngrok" application was used to temporarily make the server available on the Internet.
